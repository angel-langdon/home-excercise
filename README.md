# Fibonacci Calculator

## Requirements:

[X] The app will have a main component centred on the page both horizontal and vertical

[X] The component will display an input field, a button and an empty div where we will display some information

[X] The input filed should allow only numeric values

[X] When you click the button, the app should get the value from the input, send it to a function that will run some calculations and then display the result inside the empty div

[X] The function will receive just one numeric parameter and will return the value of the Fibonacci sequence for that position. We will assume the Fibonacci sequence starts with 1. Example:

- Fibonacci(0) = 0
- Fibonacci(1) = 1
- Fibonacci(5) = 5
- Fibonacci(6) = 8
- Fibonacci(10) = 55

[X] Unit test are optional

[X] CSS, design and any other addition to the app are optional as well but feel free to add whatever you want here if you feel the need
